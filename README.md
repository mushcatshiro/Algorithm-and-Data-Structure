addition of basic data structure in C (future plan to add in for python in algorithm_python)

data structures with "re-" are user's own interpretation, and is error prone compared to the ones without "re-" which are obtained from more reliable sources (future plan to remove all non re-)
data structures in C is to get a garsp of fundamentals (eg. pointers, memory allocation/access, recursion)
